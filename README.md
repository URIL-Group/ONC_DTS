This will take a folder full of JSON files and turn it into two CSV files, one per channel. You'll have to change the main file with the directory of the folder that holds the JSON files and the directory to where you want to save the CSV files. You'll have to also decide on a name. I choose "channel" as you see in the main file, then the code add _1 or _2 for the corresponding channel.
